The Mechatronics Lab has recently developed a single leg, direct drive robot,
Baleka, to investigate modelling and control of rapid accelerations.
This project will involve the design of a control system to perform stable
hopping with the robot. Various controller algorithms will be investigated and
compared (eg. PID, MPC, etc.). The project will also involve developing a test
rig for the robot.

\section*{Deliverables}

\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematical model of the hopping robot must be developed in
Simulink/Matlab
\item Hopping controller design
\item Mechanical design of the test rig
\item Experimental testing of the robot
\end{itemize}

\section*{Skills/Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematical Modelling 
\item Mechatronics Design
\item Control Systems
\item Embedded Systems
\item Strong Practical and Mathematical skills required
\end{itemize}

\section*{ELO3: Engineering Design}

\textit{Perform creative, procedural and non-procedural design and synthesis of components, systems, engineering works, products or processes.}

The student is expected to design:

\begin{itemize}
\item Robot feedback control system
\item Rig for testing of hopping motion
\end{itemize}

\section*{Area of Research}
