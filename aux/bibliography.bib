abstract = {— The control of dynamically stable hopping robots has made great progress in the last decades. This paper deals with modeling and control of Kangaroo hopping robot. It is a one-leg planar hopping robot which imitates the mode of displacement of kangaroos. Lagrangian dynamic model of the hopping robot is computed on the different phases of the jumping cycle. A new control scheme is proposed to control the leg thrust during stance phase for planar hopping. A nonlinear model predictive control has been combined with Raibert's approach which has improved significantly its performances. A simulator has been developed to simulate the behavior of the controlled robot. The proposed control approach is validated in simulation and is compared with Raibert's approach.},

@article{Hodgins1991,
abstract = {To travel on rough terrain, a legged system must adjust the length of its steps so that the feet land on the available footholds. This paper explores the task of controlling step length in the context of a dynamic biped robot that actively balances itself as it runs. We explored three methods for con- trolling step length, each of which adjusted a different parame- ter of the running cycle. The adjusted parameters were forward running speed, running height, and duration of ground contact. All three control methods were successful in manipulating step length in laboratory experiments, but the method that adjusted forward speed provided the widest range of step lengths (0.1 to 1.1 m) with accurate control of step length (average absolute error of 0.07 m). The three methods for controlling step length manipulated the dynamics of the system so the feet could be placed on the available footholds without disturbing the system’s balance. An alternative approach was to ignore balance for a single step, placing the foot directly on the desired foothold, and recovering balance later. This approach generally resulted in very precise foot placements for a single target but could not be used to control many steps in a row. In laboratory demonstra- tions a biped running machine used these methods for adjusting step length to place its feet on targets, leap over obstacles, and run up and down a short flight of stairs.},

@article{Raibert1984,
abstract = {In this paper a two-dimensional one-legged hopping machine is modeled and simulated in order to better understand legged systems that hop and run. The analysis is focused on balance, dynamic stability, and resonant oscillation for the planar case. A springy leg with nonzero mass, a simple body, and an actuated hinge-type hip are incorporated in the model. Control of the model is decomposed into a vertical hopping part, a horizontal velocity part, and a body attitude part. Estimates of total system energy are used in regulating hopping height in order to initiate hopping, to maintain level hopping, to change from one hopping height to another, and to terminate hopping. Balance and control of forward velocity are explored with three algorithms. First the role of foot placement in balance through a linear algorithm that stabilizes the system and generates low velocity translations from point to point is studied. Second, control of forward velocity is controlled by considering constraints that arise in constant velocity forward travel, and the CG print is introduced. In the improved algorithm the foot is placed forward with respect to the center of the CG print during flight, and the leg is swept backward during stance. Third, control of body attitude is improved by using the hip actuator to correct pitch errors during stance. The feasibility of decomposing control of running into a height control part, a forward velocity control part, and an attitude control part are verified by simulations. I. Introduction},

abstract = {A hybrid machine (HM) as a typical mechatronic device, is a useful tool to generate smooth motion, and combines the motions of a large constant speed motor with a small servo motor by means of a mechnical linkage mechanism, in order to provide a powerful programmable drive system. To achieve design objectives, a control system is required. To design a better control system and analyze the performance of an HM, a dynamic model is necessary. This paper first develops a dynamic model of an HM with a five-bar mechanism using a Lagrangian formulation. Then, several important properties which are very useful in system analysis, and control system design, are presented. Based on the developed dynamic model, two control approaches, computed torque, and combined computed torque and slide mode control, are adopted to control the HM system. Simulation results demonstrate the control performance and limitations of each control approach.},

@article{Pratt1995,
abstract = {It is traditional to make the interface between an actuator and its load as stiff as possible. Despite this tradition, reducing interface stiffness offers a number of advantages, including greater shock tolerance, lower reflected inertia, more accurate and stable force control, less inadvertent damage to the environment, and the capacity for energy storage. As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, the authors propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element within the actuator is a good idea. The authors use the term elasticity instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent in series elastic actuators, the authors present a control system for their use under general force or impedance control. The authors conclude with test results from a revolute series-elastic actuator meant for the arms of the MIT humanoid robot Cog and for a small planetary rover},
