abstract = {— The control of dynamically stable hopping robots has made great progress in the last decades. This paper deals with modeling and control of Kangaroo hopping robot. It is a one-leg planar hopping robot which imitates the mode of displacement of kangaroos. Lagrangian dynamic model of the hopping robot is computed on the different phases of the jumping cycle. A new control scheme is proposed to control the leg thrust during stance phase for planar hopping. A nonlinear model predictive control has been combined with Raibert's approach which has improved significantly its performances. A simulator has been developed to simulate the behavior of the controlled robot. The proposed control approach is validated in simulation and is compared with Raibert's approach.},

@article{Hodgins1991,
abstract = {To travel on rough terrain, a legged system must adjust the length of its steps so that the feet land on the available footholds. This paper explores the task of controlling step length in the context of a dynamic biped robot that actively balances itself as it runs. We explored three methods for con- trolling step length, each of which adjusted a different parame- ter of the running cycle. The adjusted parameters were forward running speed, running height, and duration of ground contact. All three control methods were successful in manipulating step length in laboratory experiments, but the method that adjusted forward speed provided the widest range of step lengths (0.1 to 1.1 m) with accurate control of step length (average absolute error of 0.07 m). The three methods for controlling step length manipulated the dynamics of the system so the feet could be placed on the available footholds without disturbing the system’s balance. An alternative approach was to ignore balance for a single step, placing the foot directly on the desired foothold, and recovering balance later. This approach generally resulted in very precise foot placements for a single target but could not be used to control many steps in a row. In laboratory demonstra- tions a biped running machine used these methods for adjusting step length to place its feet on targets, leap over obstacles, and run up and down a short flight of stairs.},

@article{Raibert1984,
abstract = {In this paper a two-dimensional one-legged hopping machine is modeled and simulated in order to better understand legged systems that hop and run. The analysis is focused on balance, dynamic stability, and resonant oscillation for the planar case. A springy leg with nonzero mass, a simple body, and an actuated hinge-type hip are incorporated in the model. Control of the model is decomposed into a vertical hopping part, a horizontal velocity part, and a body attitude part. Estimates of total system energy are used in regulating hopping height in order to initiate hopping, to maintain level hopping, to change from one hopping height to another, and to terminate hopping. Balance and control of forward velocity are explored with three algorithms. First the role of foot placement in balance through a linear algorithm that stabilizes the system and generates low velocity translations from point to point is studied. Second, control of forward velocity is controlled by considering constraints that arise in constant velocity forward travel, and the CG print is introduced. In the improved algorithm the foot is placed forward with respect to the center of the CG print during flight, and the leg is swept backward during stance. Third, control of body attitude is improved by using the hip actuator to correct pitch errors during stance. The feasibility of decomposing control of running into a height control part, a forward velocity control part, and an attitude control part are verified by simulations. I. Introduction},

@article{Pratt1995,
abstract = {It is traditional to make the interface between an actuator and its load as stiff as possible. Despite this tradition, reducing interface stiffness offers a number of advantages, including greater shock tolerance, lower reflected inertia, more accurate and stable force control, less inadvertent damage to the environment, and the capacity for energy storage. As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, the authors propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element within the actuator is a good idea. The authors use the term elasticity instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent in series elastic actuators, the authors present a control system for their use under general force or impedance control. The authors conclude with test results from a revolute series-elastic actuator meant for the arms of the MIT humanoid robot Cog and for a small planetary rover},

@article{Farley1996,
abstract = {When humans and other mammals run, the body's complex system of muscle, tendon and ligament springs behaves like a single linear spring ('leg spring'). A simple spring-mass model, consisting of a single linear leg spring and a mass equivalent to the animal's mass, has been shown to describe the mechanics of running remarkably well. Force platform measurements from running animals, including humans, have shown that the stiffness of the leg spring remains nearly the same at all speeds and that the spring-mass system is adjusted for higher speeds by increasing the angle swept by the leg spring. The goal of the present study is to determine the relative importance of changes to the leg spring stiffness and the angle swept by the leg spring when humans alter their stride frequency at a given running speed. Human subjects ran on treadmill-mounted force platform at 2.5m s-1 while using a range of stride frequencies from 26{\%} below to 36{\%} above the preferred stride frequency. Force platform measurements revealed that the stiffness of the leg spring increased by 2.3-fold from 7.0 to 16.3 kNm-1 between the lowest and highest stride frequencies. The angle swept by the leg spring decreased at higher stride frequencies, partially offsetting the effect of the increased leg spring stiffness on the mechanical behavior of the spring-mass system. We conclude that the most important adjustment to the body's spring system to accommodate higher stride frequencies is that leg spring becomes stiffer.},

abstract = {The mechanics of hopping by kangaroos (Macropodidae) R. McN. ALEXANDER AND ALEXANDRA VERNON Department of Pure and Applied Zoology, University of Leeds (Accepted 20 December 2974) (With 13 figures in the text) Force-platform records and films of kangaroos and a wallaby hopping have been analysed to obtain data about the energetics of hopping and about the stresses which act in muscles, tendons and the tibia. The quantitative anatomical data required for the analysis have been obtained from X-radiographs and dissections. It is shown that fluctuations of potential energy and external kinetic energy account for most of the energy cost of hopping; fluctua- tions of internal kinetic energy are relatively unimportant. Evidence is presented that large savings of energy are effected by elastic storage of energy in the gastrocnemius and plantaris tendons. The elastic mechanism is particularly effective at high speeds and seems to account for the observation of Dawson {\&} Taylor (1973) that oxygen consumption is more or less constant over the whole range of hopping speeds. A mathematical model of hopping is presented. The stresses which occur in hopping are discussed. Contents},

abstract = {The control of aerial gymnastic maneuvers is challenging because these maneuvers frequently involve complex rotational motion and because the performer has limited control of the maneuver during ight. A performer can in uence a manuever using a sequence of limb movements during ight. However, the same sequence may not produce reliable performances in the presence of o -nominal conditions. How do people compensate for variations in performance to reliably produce aerial maneuvers? In this report I explore the role that passive dynamic stability may play in making the performance of aerial maneuvers simple and reliable. I present a control strategy comprised of active and passive components for performing robot front somersaults in the laboratory. I show that passive dynamics can neutrally stabilize the layout somersault which involves an $\backslash$inherently unstable" rotation about the intermediate principal axis. And I show that a strategy that uses open loop joint torques plus passive dynamics leads to more reliable 1 1/2 twisting front somersaults in simulation than a strategy that uses prescribed limb motion. Results are presented from laboratory experiments on gymnastic robots, from dynamic simulation of humans and robots, and from linear stability analyses of these systems.},

abstract = {Passively compliant legs have been instrumental in the development of dynamically running legged robots. Having properly tuned leg springs is essential for stable, robust and energetically efficient running at high speeds. Recent simulation studies indicate that having variable stiffness legs, as animals do, can significantly improve the speed and stability of these robots in changing environmental conditions. However, to date, the mechanical complexities of designing usefully robust tunable passive compliance into legs has precluded their implementation on practical running robots. This paper describes a new design of a "structurally controlled variable stiffness" leg for a hexapedal running robot. This new leg improves on previous designs' performance and enables runtime modification of leg stiffness in a small, lightweight, and rugged package. Modeling and leg test experiments are presented that characterize the improvement in stiffness range, energy storage, and dynamic coupling properties of these legs. We conclude that this variable stiffness leg design is now ready for implementation and testing on a dynamical running robot.},

@article{Pratt1998,
abstract = {Natural dynamics can be exploited in the control of bipedal walking robots: the swing leg can swing freely once started; a kneecap can be used to prevent the leg from inverting; and a compliant ankle can be used to naturally transfer the center of pressure along the foot and help in toe off. Each of these mechanisms helps make control easier to achieve and results in motion that is smooth and natural looking. We describe a simple control algorithm using these natural mechanisms which requires very little computation. The necessary sensing consists of joint angles and velocities, body pitch and angular velocity, and ground reaction forces. Using this simple algorithm, we have controlled a seven link planar bipedal robot, called Spring Flamingo, to walk. Video, photographs, and more information on Spring Flamingo can be found at http://www.leglab.ai.mit.edu},

@article{Raibert1984,
abstract = {In order to explore the balance in legged locomotion, we are studying systems that hop and run on one springy leg. Pre vious work has shown that relatively simple algorithms can achieve balance on one leg for the special case of a system that is constrained mechanically to operate in a plane (Rai bert, in press; Raibert and Brown, in press). Here we general ize the approach to a three-dimensional (3D) one-legged machine that runs and balances on an open floor without physical support. We decompose control of the machine into three separate parts: one part that controls forward running velocity, one part that controls attitude of the body, and a third part that controls hopping height. Experiments with a physical 3D one-legged hopping machine showed that this control scheme, while simple to implement, is powerful enough to permit hopping in place, running at a desired rate, and travel along a simple path. These algorithms that control locomotion in 3D are direct generalizations of those in 2D, with surprisingly little additional complication.},
